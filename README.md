# OctoPrint-DragonOrder

Plugin that allows the re-ordering of the navbar, sidebar, and tabs by dragging them into desired location within the UI.

**Warning:** OctoPrint 1.4.1 isolated the gcode viewer into it's own plugin and as a result you may have to re-order that tab again after upgrading.

**Note:** Plugin name is a play on words similar to `Drag and Drop` being misheard as `Dragon Drop`.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
